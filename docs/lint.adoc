= Lint
:sourcedir: ../

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It is highly configurable and can be used to enforce a consistent coding style. Having linting as a part of the build process is considered a good practice.

== Install

[source, Terminal]
----
npm install --save-dev eslint @eslint/js typescript-eslint
----

== Configure

=== package.json

Add the following scripts to the package.json file:

[source, JSON]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "check": "concurrently -c auto -g --timings npm:check:types npm:lint",
    "lint": "eslint --cache",
  }
}
----

TIP: Note that `check` command was added to package.json in the previous chapter about type checking. Here we just modify it to execute linting as a part of the `check` command.

=== eslint.config.mjs

Create the following file:

.eslint.config.mjs
[source, Javascript]
----
include::{sourcedir}eslint.config.mjs[]
----

Linting will now be executed as a part of the `check` command and, therefore, as a part of the build process.
