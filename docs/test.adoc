Setting up Jest, a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of your JavaScript codebase.

If you are writing Typescript code, chances are you want to write tests for that code, and you want to write them in Typescript. Here's how to configure test runs in your application.

== Install

[source, Terminal]
----
npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom ts-node ts-jest
----


== Configure

=== Jest

In our example we will configure processing of both client-side and server-side Typescript code.

Create a file called jest.config.ts in the root of the project with the following content:

[source, TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}jest.config.ts[]
----

With this config Jest will find and execute test files in the 'src/jest/client' and 'src/jest/server' folders called `*.test.ts` (or `.tsx`) or `*.spec.ts` (or `.tsx`).

Set up `src/jest` folder structure with thess files inside:

.src/jest/client/tsconfig.json
[source, JSON]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/jest/client/tsconfig.json[]
----

.src/jest/server/global.d.ts
[source, TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/jest/server/global.d.ts[]
----

This Jest setupFile is used to mock the XP Framework, injecting standard Globals into the server-side test environment:

.src/jest/server/setupFile.ts
[source, TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/jest/server/setupFile.ts[]
----

.src/jest/server/tsconfig.json
[source, JSON]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/jest/server/tsconfig.json[]
----

=== package.json

Add the following scripts to the package.json file:

[source, JSON]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "cov": "jest --no-cache --coverage",
    "test": "jest --no-cache"
  }
}
----

`test` command starts execution of tests. `cov` command does exactly the same, but also generates coverage report.

=== build.gradle

Add the following task to the build.gradle file:

.build.gradle
[source, Groovy]
----
tasks.register('npmTest', NpmTask) {
	args = [
		'run',
		'test'
	]
	dependsOn npmInstall
	environment = [
		'FORCE_COLOR': 'true',
	]
  inputs.dir 'src/jest'
  outputs.dir 'coverage'
}

test.dependsOn npmTest
----

With this setup tests will be executed on every build, but you can also run them separately with the following command:

[source, Terminal]
----
./gradlew test
----

== Summary

With testing enabled, you have reached the end of this tutorial.

TIP: The https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/starter-typescript[TypeScript Starter] is basically the end result of this tutorial, so when creating your next project - simply run `enonic project create -r starter-ts` to get a best practice development setup, just like that!

Enjoy!
