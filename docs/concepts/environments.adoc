= Environments

There are multiple `environments` to consider:

* *Build*: The environment in which <<sourceProcessing#,Source processing>> tools run.
* *Test*: The environment in which tests run.
* *Run*: The environment in which the built application runs.

In addition the *Test* and *Run* environments can be further divided into:

* *Client*: The environment in which the client-side of the application (or tests) runs.
* *Server*: The environment in which the server-side of the application (or tests) runs.

All these environments support *different features*, and consequently also has *differing limitations*.

Typically a test environment is more limited than the run environment, and in order to write useful tests, some runtime features must be simulated.

One such feature to consider are <<globals#,Globals>>.
