When programming in Javascript there is always a global scope. Depending on which Javascript engine/environment you are in, the global scope is different.

== Browser

In the browser, the global scope is the `window` object. The `window` object contains the `document` object that represents the current web page. The `document` object contains functions and properties that allow you to inspect and manipulate the web page.

== XP Framework

In the Enonic XP Framework the global scope contains a bunch of objects and functions that are useful when developing applications.

TIP: You can read about them https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/globals[here^].
