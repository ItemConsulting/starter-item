== Audience

This tutorial is primarily for developers who are already working on an _existing_ Enonic XP project and want to start using TypeScript. It may also be helpful for those who already are using TypeScript, but want to _understand_ and _improve_ their setup.

If you are starting a _new_ project from scratch, you can use the end <<result#,result>> of this tutorial as a starter with proper configuration already in place.

== Introduction

Most projects start with a simple setup and then grow in complexity as more and more features are added. This is where TypeScript can help you keep your codebase clean and maintainable.

Before we start it's a good idea to have a basic understanding of some development environment <<concepts/index#, concepts>>.

Then we will start by <<project#,creating a project>> without any TypeScript support.

Then we will learn how to configure <<build#,building>>, <<check#,type-checking>>, <<lint#,linting>> and <<test#,testing>> for TypeScript.

Finally, we can use the <<result#,result>> to create future projects with proper configuration already in place.
