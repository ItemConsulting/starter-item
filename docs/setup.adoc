= Setup

The idea behind this tutorial is to learn how to add TypeScript to an existing project.

Most projects start with a simple setup and then grows in complexity as more an more features are added. This is where TypeScript can help you to keep your codebase clean and maintainable.


== Start point

We start this tutorial with the most basic setup possible, a vanilla project:

[source, Terminal]
----
enonic project create com.example.myproject -r starter-vanilla -d myproject
----

== Solution

If you are starting a new project from scratch or you just want to see the final result of this tutorial, you can use the following command to create a new project with all the TypeScript features already added:

[source, Terminal]
----
enonic project create com.example.myproject -r starter-ts -d myproject
----
