= Setup

The idea behind this tutorial is to learn how to configure transpilation of TypeScript in an existing XP project.

Most projects start with a simple setup and then grow in complexity as more and more features are added. This is where TypeScript can help you keep your codebase clean and maintainable.


== Start point

We start this tutorial with the most basic setup possible, a vanilla XP project:

[source, Terminal]
----
enonic create myproject -r starter-vanilla
----

== TLDR

If you are starting a new project from scratch or you just want to see the final result of this tutorial, you can use the following command to create a new project with all the TypeScript features already added:

[source, Terminal]
----
enonic create myproject -r starter-ts
----
